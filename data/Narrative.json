		"context": "Before you stands an odd megastructure approximately 40 meters in height, and 5x5 meters in width and length. It's shaped like a thin pyramid, with various degraded inscriptions along each of its corners, and appears to be a religious monument of some sort due to its complex ornamentation.",

Most of the writing has unfortunately washed away, but you can make out a few key words that describe the incident as a major event that would bring peace for thousands of years."
