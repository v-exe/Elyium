		"context": "Before you stands an odd megastructure approximately 40 meters in height, and 5x5 meters in width and length. It's shaped like a thin pyramid, with various degraded inscriptions along each of its corners, and appears to be a religious monument of some sort due to its complex ornamentation.",

		"conflicts":{
			"C1": "You notice a small, rough potrusion on the side of the otherwise unnaturally smooth surface of the monument. Small specs of dust fall out of its cracks, hinting at its recent apparition.",
			"C2": "Lines driving up the monument's smooth walls light up a cyan blue and illuminate the dust floating in the atmosphere. The lights lead to an open door on the side of the megastructure."
		},

		"choices":{
			"C1-1": "Push the extruded wall.",
			"C1-2": "Pull the extrusion.",

			"C2-1": "Enter the passageway.",
			"C2-2": "Wait to see if anything comes out the door."
		},

		"reservedConflicts":{
			"C1-1R": "The monument trembles in front of you. Pieces from its top plummet to the ground.",
			"C1-2R": "The extrusion slides further out and revelas a semi-decomposed alien corpse. Its fingers are curled around some sort of scroll."
		},

		"reservedChoices":{
			"C1-1R1": "Run.",
			"C1-1R2": "Try to dodge the debris, but stay at the monument."
		},

		"results":{
			"C1-1R1S": "The structure collapses, you escape without getting hurt.",
			"C1-1R2S": "You grab the scroll from the creature's hands. It revelas a mythical telling of an epic battle that occured near this site. Most of the writing has unfortunately washed away, but you can make out a few key words that describe the incident as a major event that would bring peace for thousands of years.",

			"C2-1S": "The door closes right as you attempt to enter it, clipping one of your fingers and breaking a part of it.",
			"C2-2S": "The door slowly closes, the lights of the structure dim."
