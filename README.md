### Plan

A breakdown of the remaining tasks (in their respective systems) to be completed for the production of this project, in (more or less) chronological order.

#### Gameplay

- Implement idle mode.

- Create map grid and algorithm to determine when to allocate entity location.

- Bring together entity map and narrative systems.

- Create conditional conflict handling.

- Add conflict reset feature.

#### Interfacing

- Add entity locations in menu screen.

- Add interaction options for when the user is near entities, in menu.

- Create startup and transition animations.

- Add entity location change option for fixing undesireable entity spawns.

#### Foundation

- Create save functionality that triggers after every narrative sequence has been resolved.

- Verify phone compatabilities.

#### Content

- Create database management tool that makes creating entities, conflicts, choices, resolutions, and conditions more intuitive.

- Make more narrative content (and images?), create main and side 'quests'.
