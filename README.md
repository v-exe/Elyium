# Elyium

_Elyium_ is an alternate reality game, and a platform for narrative experiences and storytelling.

### Plan

A breakdown of the remaining tasks (in their respective systems) to be completed for the production of this project, in (more or less) chronological order.

#### Narrative

- Add conflict reset feature.

#### Interfacing

- Add interaction options for when the user is near entities, in menu.

#### Foundation

- Create save functionality that triggers after every narrative sequence has been resolved.

- Verify phone compatabilities.

#### Content

- Make more narrative content and images, create main and side 'quests'.

#### Considerations

- Modify entity spawning system to only spawn entities if player is moving under certain speed. This keeps players from exploring Elyium when in moving vehicle.

- Create persistent entity locations for city-specific adventures and community-building.

- Add entity location change option for fixing undesireable entity spawns.
