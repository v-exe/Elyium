get player location

compare player location to all known entities

get nearest entity

show entities closer than threshold on UI



if nearest entity distance from player > threshold && random(0, 100000) == 1

	create random entity at player location :



choose random entity from non-encountered entity list

assign coordinates to entity

add entity to encountered entity list

generate narrative sequence

	var possible = check possible conflicts (if decisions[1] == true, then allow random generation to N)

	get random intro from intro list + entity(name) + conflicts[possible] + conflict choices

	>player makes choice

	either 1. save choice and simply exit out of narrative sequence, or
	2. present reservedConflicts[X] scenario and continue chain
